    "article": "Playing Liverpool in the FA Cup quarter-finals holds no fears for Doneil Henry - providing he does not have to take the train to Anfield. The Canadian's whirlwind beginning to life at Blackburn looks set to continue with a starting spot on Sunday. Injury problems in defence prompted Rovers boss Gary Bowyer to take Henry on a month's loan from West Ham on Wednesday, the same day they played Sheffield Wednesday in the Championship. Three hours after meeting his team-mates for the first time, Henry walked out onto the pitch at Hillsborough and was instrumental in the victory that just about keeps Blackburn's play-off hopes alive. Doneil Henry made a good start to his Blackburn career after joining on loan from West Ham. Henry said: 'I got a call from the manager in the morning and I was told I was going on loan and I was hopefully playing that night. 'I had to collect my stuff from Upton Park, sign some paperwork and then be on a train. I got on the wrong train, asked the ticket man if it was going to Sheffield to find out I had to get off and get on another train. 'After that finally I recognised some people in Blackburn kit at the train station and from there I was in safe hands. I met the team, did pre-game stuff and then just played. 'I was just really happy to play. It's been a while. I knew me thinking too much wouldn't be good, I just wanted to get on the pitch as soon as possible and establish myself in the team.' Henry began his career at home-town club Toronto and joined West Ham in January after being recommended to Hammers boss Sam Allardyce by former Toronto manager Ryan Nelsen. Nelsen played for Allardyce at Blackburn, where he was captain and a hugely popular figure. Canadian international Henry joined West Ham in January from MLS side Toronto. 'It was funny coming to Blackburn and walking through the facility and then seeing him amongst the boards,' said Henry. 'Ryan has been a mentor since he came to Toronto. He really has a lot of faith in me and has really guided me along my journey. I knew he was a big figure here and he was a solid defender everywhere he went. 'Junior Hoilett also played here, who's a close friend of mine, so I knew it would be a good move for me.' The 21-year-old has never been to Anfield before but did face Liverpool on their pre-season tour to North America in 2012. He knows securing the win needed to get to Wembley will be a huge task but has been impressed by the togetherness of the squad. Henry played against Liverpool in America in a pre-season game - but has never been to Anfield. Henry said: 'I'm still getting familiar with a lot of the guys but on the pitch it was great because there was constant chatter and communication and I just thought they believed in me from the get-go. 'When we get the test on Sunday, I think we'll definitely be ready. There's a lot of quality players in here so I think if we can go there and do our job, as long as we stay together as a team, it's definitely possible to get a result. 'I'm not going to shy away from the opportunity. These are the games where you can really see how far you are from the top level.' Bowyer is definitely without three defenders in injured trio Jason Lowe, Shane Duffy and Alex Baptiste, while Grant Hanley is a major doubt. But the Rovers boss has total faith in his new man, saying: 'Full credit to him and his character. 'He's been brought in to play games for us and we have to thank West Ham for allowing him to come to us. Everybody at West Ham spoke very highly of him and his performance on Wednesday backed that up. 'We wouldn't have any problems playing him on Sunday against Liverpool.'",
    "summary": "Doneil Henry, recently on loan to Blackburn from West Ham, is set to start in the FA Cup quarter-finals against Liverpool despite a hectic start and travel mishaps. Henry, who has never been to Anfield, is confident in the team's unity and their chances against Liverpool. Blackburn's manager Gary Bowyer has expressed full confidence in Henry's abilities, despite the team's injury challenges in defense.",

    "article": "The juror who single-handedly saved the life of Arizona boyfriend killer Jodi Arias by voting not to give her the death penalty is speaking out in her own defense. The 33-year-old known anonymously as Juror 17 says she's received death threats and widespread ridicule ever since she remained unmoved by 'brutal' jury room debates and an attempt to have her booted from the jury. In a multi-part interview with KPNX in which 17 will no doubt explain her obstinance, the mother of three maintained she entered the trial simply to serve her civic duty and denied allegations she was some'stealth juror' intent on saving the infamous murderer's life. Speaking out: The juror who single-handedly saved the life of Jodi Arias this month is speaking out in her own defense after receiving continued threats and ridicule. Juror 17 also addressed her past encounters with Arias prosecutor Juan Martinez, facts that would not be revealed until after the March 5 deadlock announcement. 'It wasn't easy, I didn't ask for it, I didn't want it,' she said. 'All I did was answer the questions truthfully. I didn't want to be involved. I didn't want this pressure.' Mostly, those questions revolved around what Juror 17 knew about the case going in, which, she insists, was very little. She will live: The latest Arias trial became the second to end in a jury deadlock. This one means the killer may not be handed the death penalty. 'I live in Arizona so I had heard about the case and I had seen just when they would come up on the news,' she told KPNX.\u00a0'I would hear people talk about it and it wasn't something I really wanted to get sucked in to.' When she arrived to the courthouse, Juror 17 recalls that there were many cases she could have been called to. In now way, she says, could she have manipulated it so she would. However, her detractors point to her previous connection to Juan Martinez as proof Juror 17 wanted to be in the Arias trial and wanted Martinez to lose. Fifteen years ago, Juror 17's then husband was tried and convicted for robbery by Martinez and then sent to jail. Juror 17 says she only recognized Martinez from television. Besides, she loathed her ex-husband and had been open about his abuse when question during jury selection. 'My struggles and my frustrations were always directed towards him,' she told KPNX. 'It's preposterous to me to hold a grudge or to blame somebody for doing their job.' Nonetheless, the conspiracy theorizing and social media vexation raged on. 'Not recognizing Juan Martinez is like saying you don't recognize Mickey at Disney,' tweeted @Kristyannasmom. '@katiecoolady wrote: 'bad enough my tax dollar$ went to a victim trashing defense, now to see a $tealth #juror17 entered the trial, enough is enough #jodiarias' '#juror17...your lies and deception caused so much pain and heartache that can never be taken back!!!' wrote @tarakelley320. Grudge? Juror 17 says she was simply fulfilling he civic duty by showing up for jury service in October. However, her critics accuse the 33-year-old of having it out for prosecutor Juan Martinez (center) for his having put her then-husband away for robbery 15 years ago. Meanwhile, it was revealed March 10 that jurors had questioned the holdout's objectivity because she had previously watched a Lifetime movie about the Arias case, and prosecutors were upset at the juror's social media activity as she went on Facebook and liked several local TV stations and Nancy Grace of the HLN network. The juror said her views were being ignored by the 11 jurors who wanted Arias to be executed for murdering boyfriend Travis Alexander nearly seven years ago. 'My opinion isn't being heard,' the judge quoted the holdout as saying. The holdout's identity was leaked through a Twitter account that also posted sympathetic comments about Alexander, while a pro-Arias website also published names of 11 people it said were the jurors who voted to sentence Arias to death for the 2008 killing. Outrage: Social media critics have lashed out at Juror 17 with claims she was a'stealth juror' out to save Arias, that she had it in for the prosecutor and with threats to her and her family. Reaction: Tanisha Sorenson, sister of Travis Alexander, sobs as she hears a hung jury verdict in the Jodi Arias sentencing phase retrial. 'Juror safety and the protection of jurors' personal and confidential information are topics the Court takes very seriously,' the Maricopa County Superior Court said in a statement. Dwane Cates, a criminal defense attorney in Phoenix who isn't involved in the Arias case, said the leaks won't change the outcome of the case.",
    "summary": "Juror 17, who cast the deciding vote preventing Jodi Arias from receiving the death penalty, has faced death threats and criticism, with some accusing her of being a 'stealth juror' with a vendetta against prosecutor Juan Martinez. She denies these allegations, insisting she knew little about the case beforehand and was simply fulfilling her civic duty. The controversy has sparked intense social media debate and concerns over juror safety, with the Maricopa County Superior Court emphasizing the importance of protecting jurors' personal information.",

    "article": "Kevin Mitchell, pictured, threatened to slit his victim's throat before raping her in her own apartment in New York on September 19, 2013. A convicted rapist sentenced to 14 years  has been granted a marriage licence to wed his long-term girlfriend so he can receive conjugal visits while in prison. Kevin Mitchell violently attacked the 30-year-old woman inside her own apartment in New York in the early hours of the morning, threatening her that he had a gun and would slit her throat. Mitchell, 34, pleaded guilty to one count of Rape in the First Degree at Manhattan Supreme Court on February 11, 2015. However, instead of being sent straight to a state penitentiary in upper New York State immediately, Mitchell was granted a one-month stay in Rikers Island so he could get married to Tyneka Hudson. Ms Hudson told the New York Daily News following her would-be husband's sentence: 'I'm going to stay by his side. He's a good man.' Prosecutors claim that Mitchell followed his victim into her apartment at 5.30am on the day of the attack. However, Ms Hudson questions the verdict. She said: 'No one knows the real story. Only she and him know. I can\u2019t say he did it. I can\u2019t say he didn\u2019t do it. He told me he didn\u2019t rape the lady. He said they were drinking and he put a hickey on her. I don\u2019t know what he was doing in her apartment.' Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr said: 'This lengthy prison sentence reflects the extremely violent nature of this attack, in which Kevin Mitchell raped a woman in her own home. 'I would like to thank the survivor for coming forward, and my office\u2019s Sex Crimes prosecutors for ensuring that this predator will serve years behind bars.' Prosecutor Siobhan Carty told Manhattan Supreme Court that Mitchell surreptitiously entered the woman's apartment on September 19, 2013 at 5.30am and threatened her with a knife and said he had a gun. After the attack, the victim rang 911 and NYPD's Warrant Squad arrested Mitchell four days later. Ms Carty read the victim's statement into the court record in advance of Mitchell's sentencing. She said on behalf of the victim: 'This man has completely ruined my life. I have tried to rationalise what I could have done in my life to have deserved what happened to me. The only conclusion that I have come up with is that some people in this world are truly terrible.' 'I cannot understand why the man did this to me. Why he told me he would kill me if I didn\u2019t do what he said. 'I do not know if he raped me because I only had $24, or if that was the initial reason that he broke into my apartment. If he had broken into my apartment to assault me, then why did he make me talk to him for so long? 'I was trapped in my own home for what felt like forever talking to this man and not knowing if he was going to kill me or my dog \u2014 he made it clear to me that he was very capable of both.' Mitchell has been told he can remain on Rikers Island, pictured, until next month so he can marry his girlfriend Tyneka Hudson and receive conjugal visits when he is sent to a prison in upstate New York. The statement added: 'I gave him so many chances to leave. I told him multiple times that if he left right then nothing bad would happen. He raped me anyways.' It is claimed that Mitchell was drinking at the time of the attack and told his victim 'I'll slit your throat. This is going to happen either way.' As well as receiving a 14-year jail term, Mitchell was ordered to undergo 10 years' post release supervision.",
    "summary": "Convicted rapist Kevin Mitchell, who violently attacked and raped a woman in her New York apartment in 2013, has been granted a marriage license to wed his girlfriend Tyneka Hudson, enabling him to receive conjugal visits while incarcerated. Despite pleading guilty to first-degree rape, Mitchell's claims of innocence are supported by Hudson, who questions the verdict. The victim's harrowing experience was detailed in court, highlighting the lasting impact of the assault and the perpetrator's threats during the crime.",
    "evaluation": "Score: 4/5\n\nExplanation: The summary effectively captures the main topic of the article, which is the granting of a marriage license to a convicted rapist, and includes key points such as the nature of the crime, the guilty plea, and the differing perspectives of Mitchell's fianc\u00e9e and the victim. It presents the information in a clear and logical order. However, it could be improved by mentioning the specific date of the attack and the sentencing details to provide a more comprehensive overview, hence the score of 4 out of 5."
